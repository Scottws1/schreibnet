Schreibnet stuff

<a href="https://schreibnet.com">Schreibnet</a> is a domain I created for family emails, so that if we moved or changed ISP's, our email addresses wouldn't change and we wouldn't have to go through the tedium of letting everyone know. This was back in the day when this was a routine occurrence.
My domain registration came with hosting. I've never done anything serious with it. Just experimented with this or that. These days it's a site created with jekyll as I learn about jekyll, ruby, and a bunch of stuff. I wanted a simple site where I could blog, and this fit the bill.
